PPE is a Physics Platform Engine written in AS3 and Flex. The engine works as a framework to make tile-based platform games (like the oldskool Super Mario Bros.) with physics in it.
The engine makes use of the Cairngorm Framework (my own interpretation of it) and the physics are calculated with Box2D.

Thanks to the following other Open-Source projects PPE makes use of:
